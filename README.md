# CTD
**Please note that this repository is in development and not in a stable state.** 

Load ASCII files for CTD data. Mean temperature at approximately 10 m was pulled from the survey ctd files and saved in a csv format. A heat map for the survey was created using leaflet.

All input data is omitted from the online public repository. Please contact Erika Anderson for access or if you have questions.
